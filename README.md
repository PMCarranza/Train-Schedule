# **Train Schedule**

# **Description**

The app takes user input and saves it to the cloud using AJAX in tandem with Firebase's API.

The Train Schedule app creates a schedule that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data.

Client Side Storage: uses cookies, sessionStorage, and localStorage to save and reuse user data across a user’s session.

Server Side Storage: saves user info to a database that can be reused across multiple devices and sessions. Firebase is used to accomplish this.

## **Usage**
The app retrieves and manipulates the information provided by the user with Moment.js.
The website provides up-to-date information, namely the arrival times and how many minutes remain until the next arrival.
